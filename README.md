<!-- ## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## User Experience (UX)

Who is using the site? Why / what do they hope to get from it?

### Design

The website design is set in simple, paragraph form, which is intended to make it easier for the reader to navigate. The navigation bar is clear on each page, as is the footer and the pages are labelled with a 'banner' format thus ensuring users know where they are at all times. 


The color scheme was chosen to reflect a 'red wine' color and incorporate rich, earthy tones to encompass the vineyard theme.


#### Color Scheme
The color palette was created using the palette generator [Coolers](https://coolors.co/).


WHY CHOSE THIS COLOR SCHEME?


All combinations of the colors used illustrate a contrast between background and text to ensure maximum user accessibility.


![Color Palette](/assets/images/color-scheme2.png)


#### Imagery
Why these images / where from? Include favicon and navbar 'logo'.
 

#### Fonts
The 'XX' font is the main font used on the page, while 'XX' in a bolder weight was used for the navbar and 'XX' for other accent areas. The 'Sans-serif' font is noted as a backup and will be used in the event that the main fonts aren't imported correctly to the site. These font styles were chosen for their ease of legibility and general letter spacing and were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
