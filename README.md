## User Experience (UX)

This site was built as a test to be able to participate in a hackathon with the Jump2Digital group in Barcelona Spain. As such, I would imagine the main users of this site to be the judges selecting participants. 

However, for any user, the site should be responsive on all device sizes, available in various browsers, easily legible, colorful, and reflect the theme of 'Rick & Morty'. I attempted to reach each of these goals through the design of the page and color scheme, information for which can be found below.

### Design

The website design is set in simple, paragraph form using character cards, which is intended to make it easier for the user to navigate. A few aspects of each character's available information from the API is collected and displayed on a character card. A 'back to top' button was created to give the user a quick way to return to the top of the page.

The header includes a Rick logo that, on clicking, will take the reader to the Rick & Morty Wikipedia page in Catalan.

Below the header is the search bar with a search field where the user can search characters by name, as well as 'Search' and 'Reset' buttons. 

The footer includes personal links to the creator's LinkedIn page and GitHub profile. The third link opens to a YouTube trailer of the Rick & Morty TV show.

#### Color Scheme

The color scheme was chosen based on the pdf prompt given by Jump2Digital and adapted slightly to fit the creator's personal vision of the site using [Coolers](https://coolors.co/). 

All combinations of colors used illustrate a contrast between the background and text to ensure maximum user accessibility. The darker colors were used for text: headers, character card information, etc, while the lighter colors were used as backgrounds with the bright greens as accents.

Using this color palette, there were no contrast errors when the site was put through Wave.

#### Imagery

The imagery included on this site was a simple logo on the homepage, a favicon for the browser tab, which were obtained from a simple google search. Icons were also used for the footer links and the 'back to top' button and were obtained from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons).

All other imagery, eg: character avatars, was obtained through the public API facilitated by Jump2Digital.
 

#### Fonts

The 'Bangers' font is the main font used on the page for headers and card titles, while 'Roboto' is used for the "Search" and "Reset" buttons and other character information, as well as the entire body of the website. 

The 'Sans-serif' font is noted as a backup and will be used in the event that the main fonts aren't imported correctly to the site. These font styles were chosen for their ease of legibility and general letter spacing and were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

## Deployment

The following steps were taken to deploy the live website from the GitHub repository using <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>:

1. In your personal GitHub account, locate your project's repository.

2. Click the 'Settings' tab.

3. On the left-hand side, click the 'Pages' tab

4. In the center section, select to deploy from the main branch.

5. Once built, a link will appear with a button to 'Visit site'. Clickin this will allow you to open the live page in your browser.
