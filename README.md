## User Experience (UX)

This site was built as a test to be able to participate in a hackathon with the Jump2Digital group in Barcelona Spain. As such, I would imagine the main users of this site to be the judges selecting participants. 

However, for any user, the site should be responsive on all device sizes, available in various browsers, easily legible, colorful, and reflect the theme of 'Rick & Morty'. I attempted to reach each of these goals through the design of the page and color scheme, information for which can be found below.

### Design

The website design is set in simple, paragraph form using character cards, which is intended to make it easier for the user to navigate. A few aspects of each character's available information from the API is collected and displayed on a character card. A 'back to top' button was created to give the user a quick way to return to the top of the page.

The header includes a Rick logo that, on clicking, will take the reader to the Rick & Morty Wikipedia page in Catalan.

Below the header is the search bar with a search field where the user can search characters by name, as well as 'Search' and 'Reset' buttons. 

The footer includes personal links to the creator's LinkedIn page and GitHub profile. The third link opens to a YouTube trailer of the Rick & Morty TV show.

#### Color Scheme
<!-- The color palette was created using the palette generator [Coolers](https://coolors.co/).


WHY CHOSE THIS COLOR SCHEME?


All combinations of the colors used illustrate a contrast between background and text to ensure maximum user accessibility.

#### Imagery
Why these images / where from? Include favicon and navbar 'logo'.
 

#### Fonts
The 'XX' font is the main font used on the page, while 'XX' in a bolder weight was used for the navbar and 'XX' for other accent areas. The 'Sans-serif' font is noted as a backup and will be used in the event that the main fonts aren't imported correctly to the site. These font styles were chosen for their ease of legibility and general letter spacing and were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). -->
